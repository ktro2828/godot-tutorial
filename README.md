This is tutorial of [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)

## Install Godot
You can install `Godot_v3.4.4-stable_x11.64` with setup.sh

*NOTE* : `setup.sh` creates an alias command as `godot` in `.bash_aliases`, which allow you to open godot-editor from command line.

```shell
./setup.sh
```

You can also install the other versions of Godot from [here](https://godotengine.org/download/linux)
